# madscriptz
bash scriptz to bring my cyber range machines out from the internet zone to the vmnetwork and back in

this is mainly just for keepsake but if you wanna use it (i don't know why you would want unless you got a similar setup or you are shawn),

1. change your ip address
2. change your proxies in 95proxies and the proxy
3. change basically everything
4. except the actual script bro
